| switch |           | description |
|--------|-----------|:------------|
| -h     | --help    | Show this help message and exit. |
| -p     | --profile | Specifies the AWS profile (from credentials file) to be used. |
| -v     | --verbose | Displays all log streams to be deleted (in CSV format). |

# Examples

View all Log Streams in the "production" configuration older than 180 days that contain the text "test" in the Log Group name:
    
```python aws-del-logstreams.py -p production -v -r us-east-1 -m 180 -n test ```

Delete all Log Streams in the "test" configuration older than 18 months showing only summary results:

```python aws-del-logstreams.py -p test -r us-east-1```
